# Book-making with superpowers

The Electric Book template is a code framework for producing **web books, ebooks, and print books from a single content source.** It is [packed with features for professional book production](#features), and lets team members collaborate on projects remotely. You're looking at the default website it generates. {% if  output-docs == true %}[Read the docs]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/){:.button}{% endif %}


<div class="feature-boxes">

{% include feature-box
   text="The template includes [a blank book](book/0-3-contents.html) to add your content to."
   image="logo.svg"
   link="book/0-3-contents.html"
%}

{% include feature-box
   text="Learn from [a book of examples](samples/index.html), with a partial [translation](samples/fr/)."
   image="cover.jpg"
   image-position="0 35%"
   link="samples/index.html"
%}

{% if site.output == "web" and output-docs == true %}

{% include feature-box
   text="The template's [documentation](docs/) explains how its features work."
   image="banner-image.jpg"
   image-position="0 65%"
   link="docs/"
%}

{% endif %}

</div>

You'll find [the open-source repository on GitHub](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book).

<div class="color-panel background-000 text-fff links-ccc" markdown="1">

## Skills required

To make books this way, you need some web-development know-how. You'll edit content in markdown with Liquid template tags; edit data in YAML files; commit your changes with Git; enter commands at the command line; and build and serve a static website. Design is done in Sass. Many features are written in Javascript.

If those concepts are not familiar to you, you'll need a web developer on your team to get you going, and to provide you with technical support when you get stuck.

You can also hire [Electric Book Works](https://electricbookworks.com) to handle setup or book production for you.

### Annotation

[Turn on open annotation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/setup/settings.html#annotation) on website editions with [Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is). Useful for both public comment and private team discussions. [See annotation in action on this demo](https://deploy-preview-471--electric-book.netlify.app/).

### Open-source software

The template is [open-source software](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book), so you never have to worry about being locked out of your own books, or finding yourself at the mercy of one vendor's pricing. You can change anything about the Electric Book software yourself, as needed.

Note that the template does use the excellent [PrinceXML](https://www.princexml.com/) for PDF output. Prince is not open-source, and is available as a free trial. We are [working on providing open-source alternatives](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book/issues/382).


## Technical advantages

### Free hosting

You can host an Electric Book site for free with services like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The template works out of the box with both.

### Best-practice version control

The template is designed to work with [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git) version control software. We recommend storing and collaborating on your project on GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket.

### Separate image storage
