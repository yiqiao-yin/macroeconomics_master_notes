## Dynamic index

Also see the [docs on indexing](https://electricbookworks.github.io/electric-book/docs/editing/indexes.html).

A dynamic index uses hyperlinks to the points in the text that it indexes, so that in print the page numbers are always accurate even if the text reflows, and online links to text are clickable. Here is a very short sample.

- Adler, Irene 
- Briony Lodge
- cases
  - Atkinson brothers
  - Holland royal family
  - Scandal in Bohemia
    - letter
  - Study in Scarlet
  - Trepoff murder
- Charing Cross
- Fradkin, Chris
- Holmes, Sherlock
- King of Bohemia
- luxuries
  - cigars
  - spirits
  - gasogene
- marriage
  - unhappy
  - secret
- Norton, Irene
- occupations
  - clergy
    - fake
    - Nonconformist
