## Questions and quizzes

You can add questions to your book like this one.

{% include question file="question-01" %}

See the docs for how to add quizzes and create exams.

You can also add {% include select options="fill-in-the-blank | essay question | mind-reading" correct="fill-in-the-blank" %} spaces (aka gap-fill or cloze questions), that give users feedback in web and app outputs.
