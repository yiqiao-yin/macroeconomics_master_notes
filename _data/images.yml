# Image settings
# --------------
# This file sets non-default settings for specific images.
# Add your book directory, then each image at a "-".
# For each image, you can set a colorspace (e.g. "gray", "cmyk")
# or set it to not be modified by automated image processessing.
# Possible formats: print-pdf, screen-pdf, web, epub, app
# See the docs for more detail: /docs/images/image-conversions.html#image-settings
# For advanced SVG options, see /docs/images/svg-processing.html
#
# E.g.
# book:
#   - file: "duckrabbit.jpg"
#     print-pdf:
#       colorspace: "gray"
#
# To apply settings to all images at once,
# use "all" instead of a filename.
# E.g.
# book:
#   - file: "all"
#     print-pdf:
#       colorspace: "gray"
