# Base design

This folder can contain a base design. Base designs are styles that give your project a personality, and a starting point for further customisation in the `custom` folder.

Your books will include the styles from the folder in `_sass` named `base`, if its files are structured like these ones. So, to add a new base design:

1. Rename this folder from `base` to something else, if you want to keep an empty version. E.g. `base-template`.
2. Add another, pre-populated base design folder in its place, and rename that folder `base`.
