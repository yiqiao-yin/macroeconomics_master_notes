# Web monetization
{:.no_toc}

[Web monetization](https://webmonetization.org/) allows content creators to be compensated for their work, without tracking user data or including advertisements on their sites, using the Interledger protocol for funds transfer.

Once you have set up an [ILP-enabled wallet](https://webmonetization.org/#wallets), you can activate web monetization on your ebook by pasting your ILP pointer in the "ilp-pointer" field in _data/settings.yml, and changing the "enabled" field to "true".
