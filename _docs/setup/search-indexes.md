# Search indexes

The website and app outputs include full-text search. The search index is loaded into a user's browser, and the search happens on the browser. This makes searching fast, and it even works offline. Keep in mind that this isn't suitable for very large projects, where server-side search would be better.

The search index is a content file that you need to refresh whenever you've changed the content in your project.

To build or refresh the search index, run the output script for your operating system as you would for any output, and select the 'Refresh search index' option.
