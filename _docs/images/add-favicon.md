# Adding a favicon

To add a favicon (the icon in your browser tab in web output), add a PNG image called `favicon.png` to the `assets/images/web` folder.

Or, even better, add it to the `assets/images/_source` folder and process the images in `assets` using the output script. When it asks for the book/folder you're processing, enter `assets`.

We recommend using a very small, simple image, 64px square.
