# GitHub Pages recommends using the github-pages gem to ensure

# This gem includes the current version of Jekyll used on GitHub Pages,
# along with the gems listed here:
# https://github.com/github/pages-gem/blob/master/lib/github-pages/dependencies.rb
# If you prefer to control your version of Jekyll (recommended if you
# are not relying on GitHub Pages), then comment out the following line
# and uncomment the Jekyll version above.

# This is highly recommended if your team uses Windows.
# If you don't, then comment it out to avoid Gemfile.lock inconsistencies.

# this will include the tzinfo-data gem that you need.

# This includes the kramdown parser, required for Jekyll 3.9.
